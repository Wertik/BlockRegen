# Breaking a diamond ore requires a netherite pickaxe.
# If the ore is broken at a y level below 100, diamonds get dropped with the pickaxe's fortune applied (if any).
# All the items are put straight into the player's inventory.
# The ore regenerates after 3 to 10 seconds.
#
# Create a region with /blockregen region world random world
# (creates a region 'random' that contains the whole world)
#
# Break a diamond ore.
